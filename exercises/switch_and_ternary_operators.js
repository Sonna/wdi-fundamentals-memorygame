var moviePhrase;

switch (favoriteMovie) {
// If favoriteMovie is "jaws"
case "jaws":
// Assign moviePhrase the value "You're gonna need a bigger boat."
moviePhrase = "You're gonna need a bigger boat.";
break;
// Else if favoriteMovie is "the shining"
case "the shining":
// Assign moviePhrase the value "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
moviePhrase = "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.";
break;
// Else if favoriteMovie is "star wars"
case "star wars":
// Assign moviePhrase the value "Do. Or do not. There is no try."

break;
// Else if favoriteMovie is "forrest gump"

}

// - Hit the "Run" button. Then type `moviePhrase;` into the "Console" panel and
